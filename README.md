# C500 Spirit Breaker ReadMe

This ReadMe file provides an overview of the C500 Spirit Breaker code and how it works. Please note that ForexRobotEasy is not the official developer of this product. We are only providing a sample code that can work as described in the product. To find the official developer of this product, please use MQL5.

## Code Overview

The C500 Spirit Breaker code is designed to generate sell signs based on a custom-built strategy. The code imports necessary libraries, defines a custom strategy, and executes the sell sign generation process.

### Importing Libraries

The code includes the following libraries:

- `PositionInfo.mqh`: This library provides information about the current position.
- `Trade.mqh`: This library provides trading functions.

### Custom-Built Strategy

The `checkMarketConditions()` function implements a custom logic for checking market conditions. It returns `true` if the conditions are met and `false` otherwise.

### Sell Sign Generation

The `generateSellSign()` function generates a sell sign based on the custom-built strategy. It first checks the market conditions using the `checkMarketConditions()` function. If the conditions are met, it retrieves the current symbol and bid/ask prices.

Next, it calculates the stop loss and target profit levels based on the bid price. The stop loss is set at 50 points above the bid price, and the take profit is set at 100 points below the bid price.

Finally, it places a sell order using the `OrderSend()` function with the specified risk management parameters. If the order is successfully placed, it prints a success message. Otherwise, it prints an error message with the error code.

### Entry Point

The `OnStart()` function is the entry point of the program. It calls the `generateSellSign()` function to generate a sell sign.
